# dota-2-analyse

Hello, I'm a student and a Dota 2 player.
So, I decided to calculate some metrics using lot of stuff that Dota provides to every player by open web-api
By the way, my first plan steps are:
  1. Calculate win rate each hero agains all heroes or special hero
  2. Calcualte win rate people who are in the match with you or just a man whose steam id you know
  3. Predict whose team pick is better
  4. Show a lot info about the players
